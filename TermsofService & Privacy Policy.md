Thank you for your interest in Cardonomy (the ‚ÄúBot‚Äù, ‚ÄúGame‚Äù, "Service", and ‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù), developed by the Cardonomy team ("we", "us", ‚Äúour‚Äù). To keep the game functional and provide the best possible experience, we collect some necessary data from Discord users (the "User", "you", "they", "their") who interact with the game, as well as from the respective Discord guilds (the "Server(s)") where Cardonomy has been added.
